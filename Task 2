My prefered projects are HEXAPOD & STEPEXPLORER
-In broad sense My instrests lie in Mechatronics and development of mechanical automation

//HEXAPOD
-As I said it aligns with my instrests and as mentioned in introductory summer proj. file 
 this project will suitable for real world application is what motivates me most to work hard for this project 
 and you guys mentioned it as hard , ready to face this Challenge whole summers :)
//StepXplorer
-Intrested in Mastering Embedded systems and learning PID (basic electronics).
-since it invloves automation , keen to learn that too ;)
